INSTALL
---------
Obtain source from google's SVN repository, or download the tar/gzip archive.

Un-pack the archive in your document root:

	tar -xzvf book-of-agreements-0.2.tgz

Create a mysql database for your project, and create the tables:

	mysql -u username -p databasename < sql/boa.sql

Fill in the mysql connection information found in the config file:

	public/config.php

Fill in an email address in the various single-quote delimited spaces. Add a
name for your site, which will appear in the basic auth popup, for example
"Organization Book of Agreements".

Fill in sha1 passwords, you can use the sha1.php quick utility function to
generate these.

Fill in your mysql database connection info.

Using your mysql client, add some entries to your committees table. For
example:

	insert into committees values(1, 1, 'Buildings', 'buildings');
	insert into committees values(2, 2, 'Common House', 'ch');

Now using your web browser, visit your website. There will likely be some
greeting text, but you'll need to click on the "Member Login" link in the upper
right corner in order to enter the application. You'll need to then login as
the administrative user in order to add / edit / delete documents. Visit the
following URL:

	/?id=admin

and enter the password you used to generate the sha1 string you entered into
the $admin_string in the config.php page. From there, you should be provided
with links to add new minutes or agreements.
